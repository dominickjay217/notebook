**In no particular order, these are the things I'm doing and thinking about:**

- **Working as a Software Engineer** for [RoweIt](https://roweit.co.uk)
- **Trying to improve my fitness** by eating better and exercising 3-4 times a week. Had a good routine during the 2020 lockdowns so hoping to continue.
- **Always improving and tweaking this website** towards making it visually compelling, faster, and fun.
- **Learning** React and generating patterns/artwork with SVG and JS.
- **Reading a lot more** with my current book being *The Girl in the Spider's Web* by David Lagercrantz
- **I am looking forward to** some screen downtime soon - it's been busy!.
