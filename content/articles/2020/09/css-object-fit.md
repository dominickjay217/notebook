## Let's get into it

By using the object-fit property, we can define how an element responds to its parent containers height and width. This property is mainly used alongside images and videos, and can let us have further control over how it allows an inline image to be displayed.

## What values can be used?

1. fill
1. contain
1. cover
1. none
1. scale-down
